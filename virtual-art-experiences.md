## Virtual art experiences that don't suck

### [Video tour/discussion of the Andy Warhol exhibition at the Tate Modern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjgAd6Z-dd0)
The Tate Modern is one of my perenial favourites, and I'm glad they're starting to put content online this year. This seven minute video shows some of the works in the exhibition and talks briefly about the history of Andy Warhol and his identity as an immigrant and a queer man. The [Tate's youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2isDei-lrNSrgGYE4Np3PA) is worth a visit in general.

### [ArtZoom Series](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ArtZoom)
This is by Google Arts and Culture, and is a series of short videos that focus on one particular painting, giving you some of the history and analysis. They're each about 3-5 minutes long, and I think they're pretty well done.
